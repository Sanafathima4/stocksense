# Technical Analysis Knowledge Base

## Core Principles
1. Market Action Discounts Everything - All known information is reflected in price
2. Prices Move in Trends - Up, down, or sideways
3. History Tends to Repeat Itself - Patterns recur due to market psychology

## Key Concepts
- Support: Price level where buying interest overwhelms selling pressure
- Resistance: Price level where selling pressure overwhelms buying interest
- Trend: Directional movement (uptrend = higher highs/higher lows, downtrend = lower highs/lower lows)
- Volume: Trading activity confirming price movements

## Chart Types
1. Line Charts: Basic closing price visualization
2. Bar Charts: OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) representation
3. Candlestick Charts: Visual emotion indicator with wicks and bodies

## Common Patterns

### Reversal Patterns
- Head and Shoulders: Trend reversal pattern with three peaks
- Double Top/Bottom: M-shaped/W-shaped reversal formation
- Rising/Falling Wedge: Converging trendlines signaling potential breakout

### Continuation Patterns
- Flags: Sharp move followed by consolidation
- Pennants: Small symmetrical triangles after strong moves
- Triangles (Ascending/Descending/Symmetrical): Consolidation before continuation

## Key Indicators

### Trend-Following
1. Moving Averages:
   - SMA (Simple Moving Average)
   - EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
   - Golden Cross (50EMA > 200EMA)
   - Death Cross (50EMA < 200EMA)

2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):
   - Composed of MACD line, signal line, and histogram
   - Bullish crossover: MACD > Signal
   - Bearish crossover: MACD < Signal

### Momentum Oscillators
1. RSI (Relative Strength Index):
   - Range: 0-100
   - Overbought (>70), Oversold (<30)
   - Divergence signals potential reversals

2. Stochastic Oscillator:
   - %K and %D lines
   - Identifies overbought/oversold conditions
   - Bullish/bearish divergences

### Volatility Indicators
1. Bollinger Bands:
   - SMA Â± 2 standard deviations
   - Band contraction = low volatility
   - Band expansion = high volatility

2. ATR (Average True Range):
   - Measures market volatility
   - Helps set stop-loss levels

## Volume Analysis
- Volume Spike: Often precedes major price moves
- On-Balance Volume (OBV): Cumulative volume indicator
- Volume Profile: Shows traded volume at specific price levels

## Advanced Concepts
1. Fibonacci Retracements:
   - Key levels: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%
   - Used to identify potential support/resistance

2. Elliott Wave Theory:
   - 5-wave impulse moves + 3-wave corrections
   - Fractal market patterns

3. Market Profile:
   - Time-price opportunities (TPOs)
   - Value area identification

4. Ichimoku Cloud:
   - Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line)
   - Kijun-sen (Base Line)
   - Senkou Span (Leading Span)
   - Chikou Span (Lagging Span)

## Risk Management
- Always use stop-loss orders
- Risk-Reward ratio minimum 1:2
- Position sizing based on account risk (1-2% per trade)

## Limitations
- Works best in trending markets
- False signals common in choppy markets
- Should be combined with fundamental analysis for long-term investing
